Layoffs Data: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
This section of the project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned layoffs dataset (layoffs_staging2). The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into trends, patterns, and anomalies in the layoffs data. Key metrics such as total layoffs by company, industry, country, and year, as well as various aggregation techniques (such as rolling totals), are examined.

This exploratory data analysis provides insights into key aspects of layoffs data, such as:

The largest layoffs by company, industry, country, and year.
Trends in layoffs over time (monthly and yearly).
Breakdown of layoffs by the stage of the company.


By performing this Exploartory Data Analysis, I can better understand the overall layoffs landscape and identify trends that can inform future decision-making or forecasting.
